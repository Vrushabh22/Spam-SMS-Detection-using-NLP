# Spam-SMS-Detection-using-NLP

The objective of this project is to employ binary classification models for the categorization of spam and ham SMS messages. In this context, an approach to identify spam SMS by employing various supervised machine-learning models and ensembling techniques for model optimization and enhancing message analysis through topic modeling.

The dataset utilized for the development of the spam and ham SMS detection system was compiled from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and accessed via the Kaggle platform. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted thorough testing and conducted a comparative analysis of the performance exhibited by various classification models across a range of experimental setups. The ultimate goal was to identify the binary classification model that demonstrates the most optimal performance in terms of accuracy and efficacy.
